# Welcome!

My name is Vilmantas! I enjoy working in **data science** and sharing my knowledge with others. I use Python and R daily to tackle problems across various fields, particularly in biomedicine and life sciences. I also automate processes, develop software, and contribute to open source projects. I am always *open* to learning new things and exploring new areas. My newest achievement is graduating from a data school, where I sharpened both my technical and soft skills.

## BIO

- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp;I use daily: `.ipynb`, `.py`, `.r`, `.qmd`/`.rmd`.
- 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;I am continuously learning: statistics, analytics, predictive modeling, computer vision, DevOps, chemometrics, etc.
- 🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;I teach biostatistics and R at a university.
- 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;I regularly contribute to open source projects, especially [r-hyperspec](https://github.com/r-hyperspec).
- 🌴&nbsp;&nbsp;Exotic data types I've worked with: light (spectroscopic) signals from medical specimens, microbiome gene sequences, and images.
- ⚡️&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun fact: I was awarded the best lecturer in 2019.
