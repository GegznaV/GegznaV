# Welcome!

My name is Vilmantas!
I like doing **data science** and sharing my knowledge with others. 
I use Python and R daily to solve problems in various fields, especially biomedicine and life sciences, automate processes, develop software, and contribute to open source. And I am always *open* to learning new things and exploring new areas.


## BIO

- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp;I use daily: `.ipynb`, `.py`, `.r`, `.qmd`/`.rmd`.
- 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning all about **data science**: statistics, analytics, predictive modeling, computer vision, deployment, chemometrics, etc.
- 🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;I teach biostatistics and R at a university.
- 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;I regularly contribute to open source (especially to [r-hyperspec](https://github.com/r-hyperspec)).
- 🌴&nbsp;&nbsp;Exotic data types I worked with: light (spectroscopic) signals from medical specimens, microbiome gene sequences, and images.
- ⚡️&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun fact: I was awarded as the best lecturer in 2019.
